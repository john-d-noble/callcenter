        "### Full Narrative Analysis\n",
        "The baseline models provide an essential foundation, demonstrating that even simple methods can effectively capture key patterns in the call volume data. The Naive approach, which persists the last value, yields high errors (MAE ~2,351, MAPE 25%) amid daily fluctuations, while Mean and Median improve modestly (MAEs ~1,614-1,635, MAPEs 17-18%) by focusing on central tendencies, aligning with the EDA's slightly skewed distribution. The Seasonal Naive excels (MAE 908, MAPE under 10%), directly leveraging the EDA's decomposed weekly seasonality and day-of-week variations for reliable periodic forecasts, even after imputing non-business days.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classical models, emphasizing univariate trends and seasonality, show inconsistent gains. ARIMA addresses non-stationarity (per EDA's ADF test) with an MAE of 2,268 and MAPE of 24%, but overlooks cycles. SARIMA, incorporating weekly terms, performs worst (MAE 2,561, MAPE 29%), possibly overfitting to outliers or filled data noise. ETS offers the best classical results (MAE 2,234, MAPE 23%) through smoothing of trends and additive seasonality, consistent with EDA rolling stats, but remains outperformed by baselines, suggesting limited added value from parameterization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning models advance by integrating multivariate features (e.g., lags for autocorrelation, rollings for volatility, dummies for days, and market vars like VIX/CVOL per EDA correlations >0.2), yielding clearer improvements. Ridge leads (MAE 1,011, MAPE 11%) with regularization handling collinearity and outliers. Random Forest (MAE 1,080, MAPE 11%) captures non-linear interactions via ensembles, while XGBoost (MAE 1,339, MAPE 15%) boosts performance but risks overfitting. SVR trails (MAE 1,925, MAPE 20%), less suited for this tabular time-series data. Overall, ML reduces classical errors by ~50% (e.g., Ridge vs. ETS), approaching baseline efficiency through feature-driven predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The deep learning/hybrid tier, designed for complex sequences and combinations, introduces neural architectures but yields mixed outcomes. LSTM, processing scaled sequences with lags, achieves the tier's best (MAE 2,143, MAPE 24%), capturing long dependencies from EDA autocorrelation but struggling with the dataset's scale or noise, performing similarly to classical ARIMA. Neural Prophet, extending Prophet with nets, ranks worst (MAE 3,627, MAPE 43%), potentially due to insufficient data for deep learning or sensitivity to imputation. The Prophet + XGBoost hybrid (MAE 3,868, MAPE 45%) combines trend/seasonality with residual boosting on features, but high errors suggest the univariate base limits multivariate gains.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cumulatively, errors decrease from baselines/classical (MAEs >2,000) to ML (~1,000), but DL/hybrids regress (>2,000), indicating overfitting, data scarcity for deep models, or suboptimal tuning amid EDA-noted outliers and volatility. The overall champion remains Seasonal Naive (MAPE <10%), as more complex tiers haven't surpassed it—highlighting that the dominant weekly rhythm (per decomposition) favors simplicity. ML's Ridge comes closest, validating feature engineering's value for market ties. To progress, consider hyperparameter tuning, ensembles (e.g., stacking Ridge + Seasonal Naive), or more data; otherwise, deploy the baseline for efficient, interpretable forecasting in call center planning."
