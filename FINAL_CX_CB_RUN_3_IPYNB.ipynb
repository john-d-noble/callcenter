        "Model Performance Analysis\n",
        "The Bottom Line: Your call center exhibits exceptionally strong day-of-week patterns. Only 3 of 7 ML models (43%) outperformed the Day-of-Week Average baseline, with ExtraTrees achieving an 18.4% error reduction.\n",
        "Key Findings\n",
        "1. Day-of-Week Dominance\n",
        "The Day-of-Week Average baseline (MASE: 0.700) proves surprisingly sophisticated for your data. Its strong performance indicates your call volumes follow highly predictable weekly rhythms - each weekday consistently behaves like its historical counterparts. This makes it a harder benchmark to beat than simple time-series baselines.\n",
        "2. Tree Models Excel, Linear Models Fail\n",
        "Only tree-based algorithms succeeded:\n",
        "\n",
        "Winners: ExtraTrees, LightGBM, RandomForest\n",
        "Losers: Ridge, Lasso, GradientBoosting, others\n",
        "\n",
        "This stark divide reveals that while day-of-week patterns dominate, additional value comes from non-linear, hierarchical relationships that only tree models can capture. Linear models failed entirely because your data's complexity goes beyond additive relationships.\n",
        "3. The 18.4% Improvement Matters\n",
        "ExtraTrees reduces prediction error by ~141 calls per day compared to Day-of-Week Average. While this might seem modest, it represents genuine value extraction beyond an already-intelligent baseline - far more impressive than beating a naive \"use yesterday's value\" approach.\n",
        "4. GradientBoosting's Failure Signals Risk\n",
        "The 93% performance degradation from GradientBoosting is a red flag, likely indicating hyperparameter misconfiguration or overfitting. This warrants investigation since gradient boosting typically handles temporal patterns well.\n",
        "Recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "Deploy ExtraTrees or LightGBM - These are your only models adding meaningful value\n",
        "Keep Day-of-Week Average as your safety net - It's simple, robust, and highly effective\n",
        "Consider a hybrid approach - Ensemble ExtraTrees with Day-of-Week Average, using dynamic weights based on recent performance\n",
        "Simplify your model pipeline - With 57% of ML models underperforming, focus resources on the tree-based winners\n",
        "Investigate the gradient boosting failure - Understanding this breakdown could prevent future model failures\n",
        "\n",
        "The Strategic Insight: Your call center's predictability is driven primarily by weekly operational patterns. ML adds value only when it can detect the subtle, non-linear variations around these patterns - making model selection critical to success.\n"
