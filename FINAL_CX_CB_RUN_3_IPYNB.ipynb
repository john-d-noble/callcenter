        "The Reality Check\n",
        "Your results show a mixed outcome where only 3 out of 7 ML models (43%) beat a Day-of-Week Average baseline. This reveals important insights about your call center's predictability patterns.\n",
        "What's Actually Happening:\n",
        "Strong Day-of-Week Patterns: The fact that 4 sophisticated ML models couldn't beat historical weekday averages indicates your call volume follows extremely consistent daily patterns within each week. This is more challenging than simple seasonal naive because Day-of-Week Average captures the true operational rhythm - Mondays behave like historical Mondays, Tuesdays like historical Tuesdays, etc.\n",
        "Tree Models Win: Only tree-based models (ExtraTrees, LightGBM, RandomForest) succeeded. This suggests:\n",
        "\n",
        "Non-linear patterns exist beyond the strong day-of-week baseline\n",
        "The relationships between features are hierarchical/conditional\n",
        "Linear models (Ridge, Lasso) completely failed because the patterns aren't captured by linear combinations\n",
        "\n",
        "18.4% Improvement is Meaningful: The champion model (ExtraTrees) reduces error by about 141 calls compared to a sophisticated baseline. This is actually more impressive than beating seasonal naive, since Day-of-Week Average is inherently smarter than \"use last week's value.\"\n",
        "GradientBoosting's Catastrophic Failure (93% worse than baseline) suggests severe overfitting or hyperparameter misconfiguration. This is concerning since gradient boosting typically handles day-of-week patterns well.\n",
        "Practical Takeaways:\n",
        "\n",
        "Use ExtraTrees or LightGBM for production - they're the only models adding value beyond intelligent day-of-week forecasting\n",
        "Keep Day-of-Week Average as your fallback model - it's remarkably sophisticated and reliable\n",
        "Your feature engineering worked, but only tree-based models could exploit patterns beyond weekday cycles\n",
        "The 57% failure rate against Day-of-Week Average suggests most ML complexity is unnecessary for your use case\n",
        "Consider ensemble approaches: ExtraTrees + Day-of-Week Average with dynamic weighting based on recent performance\n"
