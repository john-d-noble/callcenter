        "The Reality Check\n",
        "Your results show a mixed outcome where only 3 out of 7 ML models (43%) beat a simple \"use last week's value\" baseline. This is actually quite telling:\n",
        "What's Actually Happening:\n",
        "\n",
        "Strong Weekly Seasonality: The fact that 4 sophisticated ML models couldn't beat looking back 7 days indicates your call volume follows an extremely consistent weekly pattern. This is common in call centers where Monday-Friday patterns repeat reliably.\n",
        "Tree Models Win: Only tree-based models (ExtraTrees, LightGBM, RandomForest) succeeded. This suggests:\n",
        "\n",
        "Non-linear patterns exist beyond simple seasonality\n",
        "The relationships between features are hierarchical/conditional\n",
        "Linear models (Ridge, Lasso) completely failed because the patterns aren't linear\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18.4% Improvement is Meaningful: The champion model (ExtraTrees) reduces error by about 141 calls. Whether this matters depends on your use case - if you're staffing a call center, this could translate to better resource allocation.\n",
        "GradientBoosting's Catastrophic Failure (93% worse than baseline) suggests overfitting or misconfiguration. This is suspicious since it's usually a strong performer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Practical Takeaways:\n",
        "\n",
        "Use ExtraTrees or LightGBM for production - they're the only models adding real value\n",
        "Keep the seasonal baseline as a sanity check - it's remarkably strong\n",
        "Your feature engineering worked but only for tree-based models\n",
